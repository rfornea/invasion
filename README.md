Alien Invasion  

This program reads in a map of cities from a text file and accepts a number of aliens as a command line argument.  It then simulates an invasion of mad aliens, in which aliens can move from city to city (provided the two cities have a link between them).  If two aliens land in the same city, they destroy each other, along with the city and any links to that city from other cities.  An alien can get trapped in a city if all links to that city are removed.  

The program stops when all aliens have moved at least 10,000 times or all aliens are destroyed.
